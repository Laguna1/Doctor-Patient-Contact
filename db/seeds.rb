# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# User.create(fullname: "Frodo")
# fullnames = ["Boromir","Gandalf","Legolas", "Bilbo", "Gollum", "Saruman","Sauron"]

# fullnames.each do |fullname|
#   user = User.create(fullname: fullname)
#   Invitation.create(user_id: 1, doc_id: user.id)
# end
